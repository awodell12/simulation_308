### Timeline

Start Date:  1/29

Finish Date: 2/9/2020

Hours Spent:
* Austin: 12 Basic & 10 Complete
* Robert: 20 Basic & 7 Complete

### Primary Roles
Austin - Simulation back end (the whole Simulation sub-package)
Robert - XML file formatting and parsing

### Resources Used
Spike simulation lab, Oracle java documentation

### Running the Program

Main class: MainFX

Data files needed: 

Features implemented:
* Two typed of edges: Toroidal and finite
* Custom selection of neighborhood. 
* Fire, WaTor, Segregation, GameOfLife, and Percolation
* Configuration data are read in from XML files and allows users to select files with .xml extension.


### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
There are some hard-coded values that we didn't end up resolving. For example, neighbors and
Toroidal are hard-coded just for demonstration. That's on me (robert)

Interesting data files:

Known Bugs:

In predator prey the updating of the fish sometimes goes awry and extra fish get deleted. 
Also sometimes fish or sharks will just get stuck in one spot and not move.
